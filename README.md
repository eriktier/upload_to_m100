# upload_to_m100

This is a very simple serial file upload command, with which files can be uploaded from a Mac to a TRS 80 Model 100/102 computer.
In fact the used crates are generic for any type of source and target, but the current hard-coded settings are specific for my Mac 
and the safe settings on the TRS model 100 (102 in my case).
